## Mondrian Sequencer
### Ryan Monro


Every time I see Piet Mondrian's art I think to myself, "Hey, cool drum machine...what would it sound like?" so after six months of thinking about it I hammered something together with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io).

Have a listen [here](https://ryanmonro.github.io/mondrian/index.html). You'll need headphones to hear the lowest notes.

It's desktop only for now. More coming soon.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
