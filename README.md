## Mondrian Sequencer
### Ryan Monro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Every time I see Piet Mondrian's art I think to myself, "Hey, cool drum machine...what would it sound like?" so after six months of thinking about it I hammered something together with React and ToneJS.

Have a listen [here](https://ryanmonro.github.io/mondrian/index.html).

More soon.
